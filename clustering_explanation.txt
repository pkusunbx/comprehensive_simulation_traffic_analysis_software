To Do:
    Implement speed limits in the program

Factors:
    1) traffic density
    2) speed of lead HV of leader AV car
    3) direction of blockade
        i) horizontal - speed breakers
        ii) vertical - lane construction or broken roads 
    4) Distribution of HVs and free lanes

Experiment:
    1) speed breakers simulate
    2) brokeb road simulate

To Do:
    Circular representation
    Write paper.
    Think about previous experiment on lane changing.
    
Factors:
    1) traffic density
    2) speed of lead HV of leader AV car
    3) Distribution of HVs and free lanes
    4) Radius of circle -> the higher the more lane formation
    5) speed of AVs
    6) Proportion of AV:HV -> the higher the more lane formation

Experiment:
    1) speed breakers simulate
    2) broken road simulate

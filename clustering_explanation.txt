To Do:
    Change color of road.
    Do the experiments.
        Write paper.
    Think about previous experiment on lane changing.
    Change 5 to speedlimits methods.
    Incorporate maximum speed into speedLimits.
Factors:
    1) traffic density
    2) speed of lead HV of leader AV car
    3) direction of blockade
        i) horizontal - speed breakers
        ii) vertical - lane construction or broken roads 
    4) Distribution of HVs and free lanes

Experiment:
    1) speed breakers simulate
    2) brokeb road simulate
